DFS Desirability Script
=======================
This script reads a list of players from an Excel file (containing Name, Pos, Team, etc.),
extracts content from multiple PDF documents, queries the OpenAI API for each player's DFS
desirability, and consolidates the results into a CSV.

Configuration:
--------------
Set the following environment variables (or edit the default paths below):
  - OPENAI_API_KEY (required)
  - INPUT_EXCEL_FILE (e.g., Player_Names.xlsx)
  - OUTPUT_CSV_FILE (e.g., player_output.csv)
  - PDF_PATHS_PHASE1 (comma-separated paths for docs 1-3)
  - PDF_PATHS_PHASE2 (comma-separated paths for docs 4-6)

Usage:
------
1. Install dependencies: 
    pip install openai pandas PyPDF2 xlrd openpyxl
2. Set your environment variables, e.g.:
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR-KEY-HERE"
    export INPUT_EXCEL_FILE="Player_Names.xlsx"
    export OUTPUT_CSV_FILE="player_output.csv"
    export PDF_PATHS_PHASE1="doc1.pdf,doc2.pdf,doc3.pdf"
    export PDF_PATHS_PHASE2="doc4.pdf,doc5.pdf,doc6.pdf"
3. Run the script:
    python dfs_desirability.py

You are an assistant tasked with analyzing players for Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS). Each player is assigned a salary, and the goal is to create a lineup under the salary cap. 
The key is to identify players who provide the best value based on their salary, meaning their potential production relative to cost. Use the provided articles and content to analyze player performance and assign an appropriate DFS desirability score.

List of Articles Content:
[List of Articles and Content]

For the player [insert player name], who plays as a [insert position] for [insert team], follow these instructions:

1. Search the articles and content for any mentions of the player [insert player name] and summarize any discussion related to the player's performance, their role, their health status, DFS value, defense they are up against, or any other factors relevant to DFS.
2. Analyze the player's performance in DFS based on the information available, considering factors such as salary, expected production, matchup difficulty, injuries, recent form, and any other relevant data.
3. Assign a numeric desirability score for the player in the context of DFS lineups, on a scale from 1 to 100. A score of 100 indicates the player provides the highest potential value, while a lower score suggests less value for DFS lineups.
4. If the player is not mentioned in the articles and content, simply state "Not mentioned" for both the Notes and the Desirability Score.

**Important:**
- Output **only** the table, in the format below.
- The table **must** have three columns: Player Name, Notes, Desirability Score.
- No additional text outside the table is allowed.

**Format the response strictly as follows:**

| Player Name | Notes (5-6 sentences about performance) | Desirability Score (1-100) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| [insert player name] | [Performance overview and DFS value, or "Not mentioned"] | [Desirability score, or "Not mentioned"] |
